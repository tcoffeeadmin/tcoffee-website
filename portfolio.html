                                  <p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest 
                                    tool in the shed. She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her 
                                    thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead. Well the years start coming
                                    and they don't stop coming. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
                                    Didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head
                                    gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see. So what's wrong with taking the
                                    back streets? You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never shine if you
                                    don't glow.</p>
                                  <p>Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play. Hey now, you're a
                                    rock star, get the show on, get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only
                                    shooting stars break the mold.</p>
                                  <p>It's a cool place and they say it gets colder. You're bundled up now, wait 
                                    till you get older. But the meteor men beg to differ. Judging by the hole 
                                    in the satellite picture. The ice we skate is getting pretty thin. The water's
                                    getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire, how about yours?
                                    That's the way I like it and I never get bored.</p>
